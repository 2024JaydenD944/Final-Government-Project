                <p class="leading-relaxed">I think we do need Congress because it helps voice the peopleâ€™s opinion without having a direct democracy. It is important because since we have representatives, they focus on the people's needs. They are everyday people that too live in this country. Congress discusses bills that are presented to them, whatever they decide will directly affect the people. Having 2 bodies of congress is also good because it makes things fairer. Smaller states will have the same amount of representatives as the bigger states. While on the other hand, bigger states will have a bigger say than the smaller states. That is why we have the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">I think congress is a good thing to have in our government. It gives the people a voice in government. I like how there are 2 houses of congress because it really shows our country. Senate is fairer and the house is based on population. The senate is harder to join because you have to be a bit older and more experienced in government. It is also good to have 2 houses of congress in order to split the power of it. Congress is a big deal because of what they do, they have to decide on bills that affect the people. Basically, they discuss and create laws for the whole country.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">I think we should have Congress because they have two part of Congress that deals with different things that can impact our lives in a positive or negative way. Everyday the Congress make and discuss bills, and make laws that will help Americans with their everyday lives. It's also important that Congress exists, because they're the only part of government that can impeach the president and other officials, this way it stops the president from gaining too much power and other federal officials from becoming corrupt. The Congress is split into two different parts, the Senate and the House, so that they can deal with their own issues without thinking about other stuff, this way work in the Congress is balanced out.
