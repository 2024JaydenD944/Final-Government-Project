<h1>What is Congress?</h1>
<p>Congress is the Legislative branch of government, its job is to create and pass on laws! Congress is split up into 2 houses. The Senate and the House of Representatives. There are a total of 535 members of congress alltogether. To some it all up, Congress discusses about bills and laws. Whatever they decide on the law/bill, will decide for the whole country.</p>
<strong><p>Senate</p></strong>
<li>The Senate is the house with the experienced people, they are usually older and wiser. That is because there is a 30 year old requirement, you would have to be a U.S. citzen for at least 9 years, and be a resident of the state that you represent. Senators are in office for 6 years. Every 2 years, about 1/3 of senate is up for reelection. There are 100 members of Senate, 2 from each state. Senate works because it gives the same number of representatives in every state, meaning that smaller states will have the same say as a bigger state.</li>
<strong><p>House of Representatives</p></strong>
<li>The House of Representatives is easier to join because there are less requirements, in comparison to the Senate. There are 435 members of the House of Reps, each state has at least one representative. But the states population will determine for the amount of representatives it will get. In order to be apart of the House of Reps, you have to be at least 25 years of age, have been a U.S. citzen for over 7 years, and also live in the state that they will represent. House members serve a 2 year term. However, they can recampaign to reelect themselves.</li>
